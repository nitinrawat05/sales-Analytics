## üöÄ Getting Started

To interact with the Sales Dashboard, you will need **Tableau Desktop** installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with the actual repository URL.)*

2.  **Open the Tableau Workbook:**
    Navigate to the `Dashboard` directory and open the `Sales Dashboard.twbx` file using Tableau Desktop.

3.  **Verify Data Connections:**
    Tableau should automatically attempt to connect to the CSV files located in the `dataset` directory based on how the workbook was originally configured. If you encounter any issues with data connections (e.g., "Data Source Not Found"), you will need to:
    * Locate the data sources in Tableau (usually in the "Data" pane on the left).
    * Right-click on each problematic data source and select "Edit Data Source...".
    * Update the file path to point to the corresponding CSV file within the `dataset` directory on your local machine.

## üìä Data Sources Overview

The Sales Dashboard leverages the following datasets to provide insights into sales performance:

* **`Customers.csv`**: This file contains information about our customer base, including:
    ```
    CustomerID,CustomerName,Segment,Country/Region,...
    ```
    *(Add other relevant columns and their descriptions)*

* **`Location.csv`**: This dataset provides geographical details:
    ```
    LocationID,City,State/Province,Country,Postal Code,...
    ```
    *(Add other relevant columns and their descriptions)*

* **`Orders.csv`**: This is the core transactional data, containing details of each order:
    ```
    OrderID,CustomerID,OrderDate,ShipDate,ShipMode,ProductID,Quantity,Sales,Profit,...
    ```
    *(Add other relevant columns and their descriptions)*

* **`Products.csv`**: This file holds information about the products being sold:

    ProductID,Category,Sub-Category,ProductName,...
    ```
    *(Add other relevant columns and their descriptions)*
